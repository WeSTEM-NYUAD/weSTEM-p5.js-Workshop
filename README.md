# weSTEM-p5.js-Workshop
This workshop is designed for high school girls to encourage creative thinking and develop design thinking skills using p5.js.

##Goals
Teach girls teamwork and leadership through a group design challenge, using p5.js as a tool to design emoji for aliens. Additionally, expose high school girls to technology that could spark an interest for computer science and other science careers.   


##Necessary materials
10 computers (we will install software prior to workshop)
Main technology: HTML/CSS, JS, p5.js


##Design Challenge
Imagine life on Mars finds an iPhone that an astronaut dropped 10 years from now. They find the phone extremely useful, except for the bizarre pictures in the text messages. They want an emoji that they can use to describe their emotions. Design an emoji with p5.js that the creatures on Mars would like.
